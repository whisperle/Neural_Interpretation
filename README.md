# Neural_Interpretation

This repo for fMRI image interpretation
* Intro to Haxby dataset: [Here](https://main-educational.github.io/brain_encoding_decoding/haxby_data.html)
* Todo:
    - Implement SpaceNet on Haxby
    - 3D Grad-CAM 
    - Try Deep Lasso
    - Try CNN
    - Pretrain deep model with contrastive learning by recon (Probably we can use fMRI+image CLIP/ MAE/ Swap)
